# Ready_Player_One
2nd year college project. It was built with an idea of virtual trial rooms but wanted a bigger picture out of it. So, using the 2D coordinates of the human body generated with the camera using python, a 3D model was constructed that resembles the human body. My team consisted of two of my college mates and myself.
